[size=14pt][b]Backstory:[/b][/size]
A friend of mine made this layout as a joke in a discord server. We then played around with that idea and made up the final layout options. Because I had nothing to do (and wanted to procrastinate studying for my exams), I started making that meme into an actual keyboard for fun over the past 2 months or so. I totally didn't spend way too much of my time on this.
